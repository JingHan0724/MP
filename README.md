# MP
Creation of New Datasets for Decentralized Federated Learning
# File structure
* /controller: Directory containing the control script to run monitoring scripts
* /monitors: Directory containing the monitoring scripts (RES, KERN, SYS, NET, FLSYS, IO)
* /server: Directory containing the listeners for data transmission (run on the server side)
* install_source.sh: File to install all needed dependencies
# Differences between the monitors:
* KERN: Monitors HPC and Ressource usage -> Provided by Dr.Huertas and Dr.Feng (5 seconds time window)
* RES: Also monitors HPC & Ressource usage -> Provided by Dr.Huertas and Dr.Feng (5 seconds time window)
* SYS: Monitors Systemcalls -> Provided by Dr.Huertas and Dr.Feng (10 seconds time window)
* NET: Monitors events coming from the network (10 seconds time window)
* IO_block: Monitors events coming from the input/output (10 seconds time window)
* IO_entropy: Calculate the entropy from the input/output (10 seconds time window)
* FLSYS: Monitors events coming from the file system (5 seconds time window)
# Prerequisite:

`sudo systemctl start ssh`
# Malware samples:
* Botnet: Bashlite
* Backdoor: HttpBackdoor, Backdoor, The Tick
* Ransomware: Ransomware‚ÄêPoC
* Cryptojacker: Linux.MulDrop.14

See the wike page (https://github.com/JingHan0724/MP/wiki) for installation guidance.
# Installation:
`apt-get git`

`git clone https://github.com/JingHan0724/MP.git`

`cd MP`

`chmod +x install_source.sh`

`./install_source.sh -s username@desktopipaddress`
# Collecting data:
(1) Server Side Configuration:

Adjust the listening scripts to utilize your specific IP address and designate a data directory of your choice.

Execute the data transmission scripts on the server side, which is typically your personal computer.

(2) Client Side Data Collection (Raspberry Pi):
`cd controller`

`source env/bin/activate`

`ython3 collect.py`
